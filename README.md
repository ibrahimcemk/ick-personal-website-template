This website is a structure I created as a simple template while developing my personal website.
I first design the project in Adobe XD, and as time goes by, I see my mistakes and shortcomings.
You can see it as a starting structure for a nice portfolio site.
I will continue to progress by actively updating both my Adobe XD project and my website.
